Several things I need to do:
- commuter: aclements, the basic version of commuter. I already read through his commits from beginning to generate c test code. However, not really understand the usage of z3, and the python codes he tried to bypass the unsolvable problem. Anyway, I need to understand is the symbolic execution here(not a simple test version, but many details I need to know), the spec of fs, and the implementation he used in linux and sv6. Here is his git: https://github.com/aclements/commuter.
- sv6: Trying to understand xv6, the os of course 6.828 in MIT(https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/overview.html). Then the C++ implementation of it, the sv6. I'm really interested in it.
- Yggdrasil: The project based on commuter by Xi Wang.(http://locore.cs.washington.edu/yggdrasil/). I guess maybe it is a good way to learn symbolic execution in commuter.
- Ix & Dune
- lwip
- linux kernel: During the rt-linux study, I find it necessary to learn some details of a real OS. I will learn it as I'm working on my dissertation.

With so many things to do, remember: work hard, keep a good pace, make good plans and communicate with teachers.
